The front of the card has a large cookie with arms and legs poking out of its chocolate chip body.
He stands proudly on the bolded words "YOU'RE ONE TOUGH COOKIE."
Peeking inside, you see several lines of handwriting in neat, even lines.
We're so proud of your progress! I fixed up old Snugglebug (& included a little surprise!!) Love, Gramma Amelia and Grampa Aban
