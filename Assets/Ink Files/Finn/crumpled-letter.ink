There is a crumpled up piece of paper that looks like a handwritten note.
It reads:
“Darlin’ -
I heard from Amelia that you’re doin’ good again. 
I hope this means you can get out of that awful place and come home soon. 
Phillip decided to move out to North Liberty so you won’t get to meet him, but my new boyfriend Derek is lookin’ forward to meeting you. 
He’s usin’ your old bed right now so let me know when you’re plannin’ on comin’ home. 
Mama misses you so much baby.”
