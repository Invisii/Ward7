Floating several feet above the bed, you see a girl with a mane of red hair, short faun-like horns and skin that tapers into fuzzy brown fur.
She does not have human feet, but instead hooves slightly darker than the fur on her legs.
Her face is contorted not in pain but as if she is focusing on something, her fists clenched.
"Finn?"
You hear that voice in your head again.
