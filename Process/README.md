## 01.13.22 What are We Doing??? (Wk 1 Update)
This week is largely focused on the overall structure of our game in broad strokes. We've established the big picture story of our game (more detail in a second), and established that the idea is for the player to uncover this story and figure out what has lead to their current situation. To start, we're thinking of our story as a series of scenes we're calling echoes through which the player will experience the story. Here's a summary of that story we're looking at so far:

<br>

> 6 years ago, someone went missing from St. Margaret's Hospital's Rare and Complex Diseases Ward (located on the back half of the seventh floor of the main complex). His name was Eli, a 12 year old, and longtime patient of the ward which was founded by his father in order to assist in Eli's treatment. Though he had been stable before, a turn for the worse brought Eli down further than he had been before. As his dad sat with him, essentially preparing to say his goodbyes, Eli's powers manifested and he and his father dissappeared. 
  
> In this world each person carries with them a spirit of sorts. When you experience a particularly intense emotion, you leave behind a small amount of this spirit behind, like fingerprints which persist until you begin to draw your last breath. In this moment, your spirit is drawn towards all of these left behind fragments as if by a magnet. You are drawn to touch them almost unconsciously, collecting them back into yourself as you do, reliving your most vibrant moments. And once you are whole, you are drawn to exit through that place where your soul is most closely bound.
  
> In Eli's case, however, as he began to pass on he realized that he couldn't bear to leave his father behind, so as his powers manifested, he was able to create an Echo of the ward as a space of safety for him. There, he was able to interact with his father and observe the outside world (Floor 6, the floor just below his ward) but never interact with anyone or anything else. Time passed, and Eli grew older and more frustrated. Yesterday, it came to a tee. Eli realized since he had created the echo, he should be able to rip a tear in it so he could pass back into the outside world, get some of the interaction he craves, and then just come right back into safety. Then he could really solve this problem, since he knew this was dangerous and not a permanent solution.

> He opened a rift and passed through, but as he did he seemed to lose control of himself. What Eli didn't account for was the fact that outside the Echo he was essentially a raw spirit being drawn to a close. He was drawn to his old room, currently inhabited by a young girl named Marlowe, and began collecting the pieces of his spirit which he had impressed into the room. Lastly, using perhaps his last semblance of understanding from the Echo, he entered into Marlowe, essentially possessing her.
<br>
This is where the player will begin, as Eli's spirit trapped unknowingly in Marlowe's body. The echo had provided a stasis for his spirit, but for all intensive purposes he's still dying, just slower, and with a strange case of recovering memories he has formed, in some ways, after his death. At this moment, our concept for gameplay is essentially point-and-click storytelling where the player will enter each room (represented by a scene for each current patient) and examine objects in the room, collecting bits of story slowly and nonlinearly. As such, we are thinking of our game/story in terms of scenes. Our goals for this week are to solidify a number of these scenes so Calvin can begin storyboarding for the illustrations he'll be doing, and to create a prototype of a scene using Unity.

## 01.10.22 Learning How to Speak
Hello and welcome to the initial commit of Ward7! This project is being completed as part of my undergraduate degree in Creative Technology and Design (CTD). I am working with the lovely [Calvin Logan](https://www.calvinlogan.org/), a talented illustrator and storyteller.

Over the next coming weeks we will be further deciding our concept and storyline. For now, I have simply implemented connection to Inky for the basis of a dialogue system. Cheers!
