## 01.10.22 Learning How to Speak
Hello and welcome to the initial commit of Ward7! This project is being completed as part of my undergraduate degree in Creative Technology and Design (CTD). I am working with the lovely [Calvin Logan](https://www.calvinlogan.org/), a talented illustrator and storyteller.

Over the next coming weeks we will be further deciding our concept and storyline. For now, I have simply implemented connection to Inky for the basis of a dialogue system. Cheers!
